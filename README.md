R code for paper 'Multivariate posterior inference for spatial models with the
Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation' by V. Gómez-Rubio and F.
Palmí-Perales. A draft of this paper is available at
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03891](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03891).

The examples in the R code are:

* Manski model (SAC model) for spatial econometrics.

* Multivariate disease mapping model with disease-specific and shared spatial effects.
